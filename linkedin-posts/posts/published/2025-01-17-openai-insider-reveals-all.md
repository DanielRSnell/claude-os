An OpenAI employee just left after 14 months and decided to tell all.

No trade secrets. No drama. Just raw, unfiltered insights about what it's actually like inside the $200B AI giant.

Here's what they revealed:

**The growth is insane.** When they joined in May 2024, OpenAI had 1,000 employees. One year later? Over 3,000. They went from new hire to top 30% tenure in just 12 months.

**Everything runs on Slack. No email.** They received maybe 10 emails their entire time there. If you're not organized, you'll drown in notifications. This is how a 3,000-person company operates.

**GPU costs dwarf everything.** One small Codex feature burned through the same GPU resources as their entire previous company's infrastructure. "Nearly everything is a rounding error compared to GPU cost."

**They ship FAST.** Codex went from first line of code to full launch in 7 weeks. Not a prototype - a complete product that's generated 630,000 pull requests. The team worked until midnight, slept a few hours, then came back at 7am.

**No roadmaps.** When they asked about Q1 plans, the answer was "this doesn't exist." Progress is bottoms-up. Researchers operate like "mini-executives" pursuing their own ideas.

**Multiple teams build the same thing.** There were 3-4 different Codex prototypes before launch. Similar parallel efforts exist across the company. The best implementation wins.

**It's secretive but serious.** They couldn't tell anyone what they worked on. Revenue numbers are closely guarded. News often breaks externally before employees know.

**Leadership is hands-on.** Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and other execs regularly jump into Slack discussions. "No absentee leaders."

**They change direction instantly.** The company pivots on a dime when new information comes in. "Google clearly doesn't" have this agility at scale.

But here's what surprised me most:

Despite all the drama in the press, they insist "everyone I met there is actually trying to do the right thing." The company gives free access to cutting-edge models to anyone, even without login. They could easily gate everything behind enterprise contracts, but they don't.

The employee's verdict? They were "deeply conflicted" about leaving. It's "hard to imagine building anything as impactful as AGI."

What fascinates me is how a company this large still operates like a startup. No email? Parallel competing projects? 7-week product launches? This isn't how big tech usually works.

With insider accounts like this becoming more common, I can't help but wonder: How many OpenAI employees are already drafting their tell-all books? The stories from these early days of AI development could potentially be worth millions.

Also, we seem to be in an era where employees freely share company internals after leaving. Is this openness good for industry, or are we starting to break some unwritten rules here?
