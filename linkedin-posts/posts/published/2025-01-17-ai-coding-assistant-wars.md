The AI coding assistant space is exploding, and the numbers are staggering.

GitHub Copilot has millions of users. Cursor raised at a $2.5B valuation. Google just acqui-hired Windsurf's team for $2.4B. Amazon launched Kiro. And now Anthropic's Claude Code is reporting 5.5x revenue growth in just 7 months.

We're witnessing the biggest shift in how software gets built since IDEs were invented.

The challenge: Enterprise buyers have been flying blind. They're paying anywhere from $10-40 per developer per month with zero visibility into whether these tools actually work.

That just changed.

Anthropic announced today a full analytics dashboard for Claude Code that tracks everything: lines of code accepted, suggestion rates, spend per developer, usage patterns. It's the first real attempt to answer the CFO's question: "Is this AI thing actually worth it?"

The growth numbers behind this move are wild:
- Claude Code revenue up 5.5x since May
- Active users increased 300%
- Major enterprises like Figma, Rakuten, and Intercom are already on board

"This is not cheap. This is a premium tool," admits Adam Wolff, who runs Claude Code at Anthropic. At $17+/month per developer (higher for enterprise), they're positioning at the luxury end of the market.

The competitive landscape is fierce:
- GitHub Copilot: The incumbent with Microsoft's distribution power
- Cursor: The developer favorite that moves fast
- Windsurf: Just got absorbed by Google
- Claude Code: The premium "agentic" option
- Amazon Kiro: Powered by Claude but integrated with AWS

What's fascinating is that developers are using multiple tools. The best engineers aren't loyal to one platform - they're using "exactly the right tool for the job," as Wolff puts it.

But the real story isn't about features or pricing. It's about accountability.

For the first time, engineering managers can see which developers are actually using these tools, what their acceptance rates are, and whether the investment is paying off. Some companies want to maximize spend because they see it as a multiplier. Others need to justify every dollar.

The privacy angle is clever - it only tracks metadata, not actual code. So you get insights without becoming Big Brother.

We're entering the accountability phase of AI coding tools. The honeymoon period of "everyone needs AI" is over. Now it's "prove it works."

My take: The platforms that can demonstrate real ROI will win the enterprise market. Those that can't will become expensive toys.

Which AI coding assistant does your team use? And more importantly - can you prove it's making them more productive?
