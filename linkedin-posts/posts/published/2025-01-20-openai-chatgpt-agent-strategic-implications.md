A deep research model. 

A computer-use operator. 

A sandboxed terminal.

OpenAI released one unified agent that can seamlessly move between researching, browsing, coding, and executing, all while maintaining context across every action.

ChatGPT's new agent mode fundamentally changes what we mean by "AI assistance." It's not switching between different tools or models. It's one intelligent system with access to its own virtual computer that can fluidly shift between reasoning and action. 

Need competitive analysis? It researches, downloads data, runs calculations, and delivers a formatted slide deck. Planning an event? It checks calendars, researches venues, compares prices, and can even make bookings.

The performance metrics reveal just how capable this unified approach has become. ChatGPT agent outperforms humans on data science tasks by 25 percentage points. It achieves 71% accuracy on investment banking modeling tasks. On spreadsheet manipulation, it more than doubles the performance of Copilot in Excel.

But raw performance and benchmarks is snooze worthy in this environment.  The real breakthrough is integration. AI agents always suffer from fragmentation. Operator could click and browse but couldn't analyze deeply. Deep research could synthesize information but couldn't interact with dynamic websites. Now these capabilities exist within a single agent that maintains full context as it moves between tasks.

This changes the calculus for every knowledge worker and business leader. Tasks that previously required human judgment because they involved multiple steps across different platforms are now automatable. Converting dashboards to presentations. Updating financial models with fresh data. Conducting market research and packaging findings. These aren't theoretical capabilities anymore.

We're entering an era where AI doesn't just inform decisions but executes them. Where "let me look into that" becomes "here's what I found, analyzed, and prepared for you." Where the boundary between thinking and doing dissolves.

The companies still asking "should we adopt AI?" are asking the wrong question. The right question is "how fast can we integrate AI agents into our operations?" Because while they're debating, their competitors' AI agents are already working.
