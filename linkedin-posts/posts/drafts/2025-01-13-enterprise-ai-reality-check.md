# LinkedIn Post: The Enterprise AI Reality Check

While Silicon Valley talks AGI,

Enterprise companies are quietly doing something more interesting.

They're actually deploying AI agents that work.
  
68% of large enterprises have adopted agentic AI.
33% are actively deploying agents in production.

That's a threefold increase from just two quarters ago.

But an interesting note: The companies succeeding aren't chasing the latest model or building ChatGPT clones.

Intuit built invoice agents for QuickBooks. Result? Businesses get paid 5 days faster with 10% higher success rates.

Capital One created agent teams that mirror their company functions. Each agent handles specific tasks like risk evaluation and loan matching.

Highmark Health uses AI for multilingual customer communication and medical claims processing.

These aren't giant, company altering projects. They're solving boring, profitable problems today.

And a lot of them are doing it with small teams. Squads of 3-4 engineers that can actually ship products? Way better than the "AI transformation" approach.

This isn't the AI story getting headlines, but it might be the most important one.

While everyone debates when AGI arrives, thousands of companies are building the AI-powered business operations of the future. And they're doing it with practical agents, small teams, and real results.

The quiet AI transformation is happening right now.

Are you part of it?
