# OpenAI Launches ChatGPT Agent: AI That Can Work For You on Its Own Computer

ChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer, handling complex tasks from start to finish.

You can now ask ChatGPT to handle requests like "look at my calendar and brief me on upcoming client meetings based on recent news," "plan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four," and "analyze three competitors and create a slide deck." ChatGPT will intelligently navigate websites, filter results, prompt you to log in securely when needed, run code, conduct analysis, and even deliver editable slideshows and spreadsheets that summarize its findings. 

At the core of this new capability is a unified agentic system. It brings together three strengths of earlier breakthroughs: Operator's ability to interact with websites, deep research's skill in synthesizing information, and ChatGPT's intelligence and conversational fluency.

ChatGPT carries out these tasks using its own virtual computer, fluidly shifting between reasoning and action to handle complex workflows from start to finish, all based on your instructions.

Most importantly, you're always in control. ChatGPT requests permission before taking actions of consequence, and you can easily interrupt, take over the browser, or stop tasks at any point.

Starting today, Pro, Plus, and Team users can activate ChatGPT's new agentic capabilities directly through the tools dropdown from the composer by selecting 'agent mode' at any point in any conversation. 

While ChatGPT agent is already a powerful tool for handling complex tasks, today's launch is just the beginning. We'll continue to iteratively add significant improvements regularly, making it more capable and useful to more people over time.

## A natural evolution of Operator and deep research

Previously, Operator and deep research each brought unique strengths: Operator could scroll, click, and type on the web, while deep research excelled at analyzing and summarizing information. But they worked best in different situations: Operator couldn't dive deep into analysis or write detailed reports, and deep research couldn't interact with websites to refine results or access content requiring user authentication. In fact, we saw that many queries users attempted with Operator were actually better suited for deep research, so we brought the best of both together.

By integrating these complementary strengths in ChatGPT and introducing additional tools, we've unlocked entirely new capabilities within one model. It can now actively engage websites—clicking, filtering, and gathering more precise, efficient results. You can also naturally transition from a simple conversation to requesting actions directly within the same chat.

## An agent that works for you, with you 

We've equipped ChatGPT agent with a suite of tools: a visual browser that interacts with the web through a graphical-user interface, a text-based browser for simpler reasoning-based web queries, a terminal, and direct API access. The agent can also leverage ChatGPT connectors, which allows you to connect apps like Gmail and Github so ChatGPT can find information relevant to your prompts and use them in its responses. You can also log in on any website by taking over the browser, allowing it to go deeper and broader in both its research and task execution. 

All this is done using its own virtual computer, which preserves the context necessary for the task, even when multiple tools are used—the model can choose to open a page using the text browser or visual browser, download a file from the web, manipulate it by running a command in the terminal, and then view the output back in the visual browser. The model adapts its approach to carry out tasks with speed, accuracy, and efficiency.

ChatGPT agent is designed for iterative, collaborative workflows, far more interactive and flexible than previous models. As ChatGPT works, you can interrupt at any point to clarify your instructions, steer it toward desired outcomes, or change the task entirely. It will pick up where it left off, now with the new information, but without losing previous progress. Likewise, ChatGPT itself may proactively seek additional details from you when needed to ensure the task remains aligned with your goals.

## Broadening real-world utility 

These unified agentic capabilities significantly enhance ChatGPT's usefulness in both everyday and professional contexts. At work, you can automate repetitive tasks, like converting screenshots or dashboards into presentations composed of editable vector elements, rearranging meetings, planning and booking offsites, and updating spreadsheets with new financial data while retaining the same formatting. In your personal life, you can use it to effortlessly plan and book travel itineraries, design and book entire dinner parties, or find specialists and schedule appointments.

## Performance benchmarks

The model's elevated capabilities are reflected in its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on evaluations:

- **Humanity's Last Exam**: 41.6% (new SOTA)
- **FrontierMath**: 27.4% accuracy, outperforming previous models by wide margin
- **DSBench Data Analysis**: 89.9% (vs 64.1% human performance)
- **DSBench Data Modeling**: 85.5%
- **SpreadsheetBench**: 45.5% with .xlsx access (vs 20% Copilot in Excel)
- **Investment Banking Modeling Tasks**: 71.3% mean accuracy
- **BrowseComp**: 68.9% (new SOTA)
- **WebArena**: 65.4% (vs 78.2% human)

## Safety and limitations

This release marks the first time users can ask ChatGPT to take actions on the web. Key safety measures include:

- Explicit user confirmation before consequential actions
- Active supervision ("Watch Mode") for critical tasks like sending emails
- Proactive risk mitigation: refuses high-risk tasks like bank transfers
- Privacy controls: single-click deletion of browsing data
- Secure browser takeover mode: ChatGPT doesn't collect or store data entered during takeover sessions

The model is classified as "High Biological and Chemical capabilities" under OpenAI's Preparedness Framework, with enhanced safeguards including dual-use refusal training, always-on classifiers and reasoning monitors.
