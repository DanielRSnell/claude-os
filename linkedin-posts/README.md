## Writing Tips

### Effective LinkedIn Posts

1. **Strong Hook**: Start with a question, surprising fact, or bold statement
2. **Value First**: Lead with insights, not self-promotion
3. **Easy Scanning**: Use line breaks, bullets, and short paragraphs
4. **Clear CTA**: End with a specific question or invitation
5. **Strategic Hashtags**: Use 3-5 relevant hashtags

### Style Guidelines

- **One Flow**: Write posts as continuous content without section headers
- **Strong Hooks**: Can use dramatic language in opening to grab attention
- **Body Content**: Avoid overused buzzwords like "game-changer", "revolution", "disrupt"
- **No Em Dashes**: Avoid em dashes (—) as they're currently flagged as AI writing
- **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and data over vague claims
- **Professional Tone**: Conversational but credible
- **Strategic Focus**: Emphasize market dynamics and business implications

### Content Types That Perform Well

- **News Commentary**: Add unique perspective to trending topics
- **Lessons Learned**: Share actionable insights from experiences
- **Industry Analysis**: Break down complex topics simply
- **Career Advice**: Practical tips for professional growth
- **Thought Leadership**: Challenge conventional thinking

## Workflow Best Practices

   - Post regularly (aim for 2-3 times per week)
   - Develop recognizable content themes

3. **Engage Authentically**
